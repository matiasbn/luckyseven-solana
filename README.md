## Program functionality

This program is intended to create a decentralized lottery, where anyone can create a random number, and once the lottery is finalized, the winner takes the big prize.

## TODO
- [ ] Use Oracle to get random numbers
- [ ] Mint fungible tokens, and offer them in exchange of SOL, based in Oracle Feed price
- [ ] Request Token to purchase numbers (ERC-20 like)
- [ ] Mint a NFT to the number purchaser (ERC-721 like)
